Topic : Secure Data Hiding in Image Using Steganography 

Overview :
This project implements image steganography with encryption, allowing users to hide and securely encode a message inside an image. The message is encrypted before embedding, ensuring enhanced security.

Features :
Steganography: Hides the encrypted message inside an image using LSB (Least Significant Bit) encoding.

Decryption & Extraction: Retrieves the hidden message, decrypts it, and displays it.

User-Friendly GUI: Built with Tkinter for easy interaction.

Requirements :
Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy
Tkinter
Cryptography (cryptography.fernet)
